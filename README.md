# Dungeon Chest Encounter
I was always curious how opening a loot chest in a computer game might work.  
So I decided to write a short script that generates loot if you are lucky enough to survive the encounter. 50% of the chests contain a deadly trap that kills the player upon opening!

### What is the purpose of this?
I wanted to try out Python dataclasses and this seemed fun enough.
